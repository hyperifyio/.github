## Empowering Secure, Custom PKI Networks

### Our Mission

Our goal is to empower organizations and software developers with the necessary
tools to create their own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) networks. This
initiative is aimed at enhancing the security of their software solutions from
the ground up.

## The Role of `webhsm`

At the heart of this ecosystem is [`webhsm`](https://github.com/hyperifyio/webhsm).
It provides a solid foundation for secure cryptographic operations within 
web applications, ensuring that sensitive operations are handled with the 
utmost security.

## Introducing `webrouter`

In tandem with `webhsm`, we are excited about our upcoming project,
`webrouter`. This project is set to transform how raw TCP connections are
managed in web environments by utilizing a WebSocket-based routing mechanism.
This groundbreaking approach allows for the use of custom TLS connections. It's
an essential step in deploying end-to-end encrypted mutual TLS (mTLS)
connections that meet the specific needs of custom software projects.

## Bridging Security Gaps

Our comprehensive suite of solutions tackles a critical gap in web application
security, enabling the use of custom SSL configurations that were previously
only feasible in native and mobile applications. This not only fortifies the
security landscape of digital platforms but also provides a robust defense
against sophisticated phishing schemes. These schemes exploit the widespread
availability of globally recognized SSL certificates to deceive users.

## Looking Forward

With `webhsm` and `webrouter`, we are paving the way for a new era of secure,
web-based applications. These applications will benefit from unparalleled
confidence in their connectivity and data integrity, marking a significant leap
forward in web application security.
